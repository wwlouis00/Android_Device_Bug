Android provides a variety of powerful debugging tools for analyzing and debugging Android applications. These tools offer a range of functionalities, from app performance profiling to tracking program errors, and monitoring device and emulator statuses. Here are some commonly used Android debugging tools:

## 1. Android Debug Bridge
ADB is a versatile command-line tool for communicating with Android devices connected to a development machine. Developers can utilize ADB to perform various tasks such as installing and uninstalling applications, copying files, debugging, and testing, etc. Here's a simple implementation example:

1. Open your project in Android Studio.
2. Click on the Android Profiler panel.
3. Choose the metrics you want to monitor, such as CPU, memory, network, etc.
4. Run your application and observe the performance data.

## 4. Hierarchy Viewer
Hierarchy Viewer is a visual tool used to inspect and analyze the user interface of Android applications. Here's a simple implementation example:

1. Open your project in Android Studio.
2. Select the layout XML file you want to inspect.
